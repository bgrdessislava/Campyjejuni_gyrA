#Steps to get ClonalFrameML to work in HPC

#First we need to see what version of Python we have
module spider anaconda

#Step 1 - Run the Python 3 - conda environment allows you to download software
module load Anaconda3/2020.11 

#Step 2 - You need to create a virtual environment to download clonalframeML
#Once the module is loaded you can use the conda commands to create a virtual 
#environment in your $DATA area. For example to create an environment named 
#"myenv" in $DATA we can use the following commands:
export CONPREFIX=$DATA/clonalframe

#creating an environment at $CONPREFIX  that includes my $DATA/clonalframe
conda create --prefix $CONPREFIX --copy -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults clonalframeml
